# squid_bot
A discord bot built with python that provides a variety of functions for users such as a gpt chat bot or short motavational peptalks. 


To run this project:

1. You will need python (make sure to have the PATH checked when installing)

2. You will also need credentials for OpenAI as well as Discord. Store these credentials in a .gitignore file.
    - Log into your Discord Developer Portal and create the bot to get a discord bot token and do the same with OpenAI to get the OpenAi api key.
    - **WARNING: Do not share these tokens with anyone or post it online!!!**

3. To install dependencies inside a terminal run the following command  
    `pip install discord openai`
    
4. Once all dependencies have been installed, and tokens properly stored for reference. You can locally run the program and the bot should log in and be available in the server for use. 
    - In discord: `!help` to see available functions.
